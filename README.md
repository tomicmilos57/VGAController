# VGA Controller for FPGA Cyclone III

This project demonstrates a VGA controller designed for an FPGA Cyclone III. The controller is capable of drawing rectangles on the screen by sending 12-bit color data through RGB wires and utilizing 2 bits for horizontal and vertical synchronization (H_SYNC and V_SYNC).
